# DID Registry demo

A guide on how to interact with Fractla's [DID Registry](https://github.com/trustfractal/web3-identity#option-2-did-registry-lookup).

## ⚠️ Work in Progress ⚠️

We're still building this guide. If you need help today, get in touch through <sales@fractal.id>.

## Overview

In order to get our hands dirty with some mock data, we will:

- Deploy a mock version of Fractal's [DID Registry](https://github.com/trustfractal/web3-identity/blob/main/FractalRegistry.sol) using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Understand how Fractal operates this contract
- Create a mintable ERC20 token, and require its mint function to be called by KYC-approved addresses

## Setup and deploy

- Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Clone this git repo as a workspace
